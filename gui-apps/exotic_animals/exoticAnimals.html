    <figure>
      <img src="images/ogre.jpeg" alt="">

      <img src="images/manticore.jpeg" alt="">
      <figcaption>A manticore has a vaguely humanoid head, the body of a lion, and the wings of a dragon. Its long tail ends in a cluster of deadly spikes that can impale prey at impressive range.</figcaption>

    <figure>
      <img src="images/beholder.jpeg" alt="">
      <figcaption>A beholder’s spheroid body levitates at all times, and its great bulging eye sits above a wide, toothy maw, while the smaller eyestalks that crown its body twist and turn to keep its foes in sight. When a beholder sleeps, it closes its central eye but leaves its smaller eyes open and alert.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <img src="images/dragon.jpeg" alt="">
      <figcaption>The most cunning and treacherous of true dragons, green dragons use misdirection and trickery to get the upper hand against their enemies. A green dragon is recognized by the crest that begins near its eyes and continues down its spine, reaching full height just behind the skull.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <img src="images/flumph.jpeg" alt="">
      <figcaption>The mysterious flumphs drift through the Underdark, propelled through the air by the jets whose sound gives them their name. A flumph glows faintly, reflecting its moods in its color. Soft pink means it is amused, deep blue is sadness, green expresses curiosity, and crimson is anger.</figcaption>
